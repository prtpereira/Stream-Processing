# Stream-Processing
Operating Systems project

Stream processing system. This system uses a component network to filter, modify and process an event data flux. Typically, it allows to manage a large amount of data, exploring OS concurrency, pipelining and kernel routines. 

A distributed system that also follows these explored techniques is Apache Storm 2. In this case, the implementation is developed for Unix systems only, exploring stream processing with pipeline filter.
